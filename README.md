# Hi, I'm Manuel ðŸ‘‹
Engineer by training and scientist by profession.

## Technologies I have worked with so far
Here's a summary of technologies (software, operating systems, programming languages etc.) I have worked with so far, both privately and professionally.
While not exhaustive, it includes the most relevant stuff.

### Git
Self-taught user for over three years.
Have started locally on command line (Git Bash), worked with graphical tools (Git GUI, gitk), and Web-based frontends (GitHub, Gitlab).
Have even given an introduction to Git(lab) to my colleagues at work.

### [Matlab](https://www.matlab.com)
Has been my daily driver for more than six years, for data analysis, simulation and model fitting.
I consider myself very proficient with it.

### Python scripting
Self-taught user for over three years.
Have mostly used scientific libraries (NumPy, SciPy) and [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), whenever I needed a free replacement for Matlab.
Also wrote small command-line applications, and used it for basic web scraping.

### Ubuntu GNU/Linux
Did my first installation of Xubuntu about nine years ago.
Have been using different variants of Ubuntu since then, both on desktop and server.

### [Vim](https://www.vim.org)
Not my daily driver, and I have not gone through the lengths of [configuring](https://github.com/amix/vimrc/blob/master/vimrcs/basic.vim) everything to my needs.
However, I have found certain functionality very useful, such as Visual Block Mode, or Search&Replace with regular expressions, and use it to save me tons of tedious editing work.

### Miscellaneous
Home networking, OpenWrt, SSH, Virtualbox, VPN
